Hi, $company SECURITY TEAM 

I'M $name 

Vulnerabilty:
Reflected xss in ($bug ).

STEPS TO REPRODUCE :

1).  Go to ($bug ). 
2).  Go to search tab and paste this payload  $payload
    and search .
3). Then see the response in browser and the popup will appear. 

NOTE: I also attached a video POC 

Impact :

With the help of xss a hacker or attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from real website to fake one. hacker can steal their cookies and download a malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with xss.

Hi, $company

I have discovered that $company is vulnerable to an Open redirect vulnerability .

Proof Of Concept :
   
   $bug
   
You should be redirected to $redirect

Impact:

The user may be subjected to phishing attacks by being redirected to an untrusted and attacker controlled web page that appears to be a trusted web site. The phishers may then steal the userâ€™s credentials and then use these credentials to access the legitimate web site. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.
